import Notation from "@components/Notation.astro";

This <Notation type="highlight" color="crimson">post should show up in proper chronological order</Notation> even though its folder comes last in the
`content/blog` directory.

The `Previous Post` and `Next Post` buttons under each blog post should also keep the proper chronological order, based on the frontmatter `date` field.
